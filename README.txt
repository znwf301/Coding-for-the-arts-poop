#README file

This is the readme file for your project. You should use the template below to write your own readme file.
You should delete all lowercase text below and replace it with your own writing. You should include all
titles below (indicated by being all-caps) but you should remove the rest of the text and replace with
your own. The lower-case text suggests how you might focus your response to each section, but is only
a suggestion. The key thing is to ensure you conform to the demands of the assessment and marking criteria 
uploaded to Moodle. You are welcome to include additional titles and text as you desire beyond these.

A copy of this can be found on notion here: https://hughdeleuzer.notion.site/ReadMe-File-Template-190c92fdf1c680d3a3cfc06f349aff28?pvs=4

OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
Describe your project in a few sentences. What is it about? What are its key technical features? 
What are its key themes, aesthetics, etc.

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION
Each team members should write a detailed explanation of their individual contribution to the project.
Be specific: 50% of your mark will be based on your individual contributions, so your marker needs to
know exactly what you contributed. Explain your process and how you went about it. What research did
you do? How did you implement your contributions into the project? What challenges did you face? How did
you overcome these challenges (note: realising that it would be beyond the scope of your project is
not a failure! Explain what you did instead to keep in scope. Balancing your ambitions versus the
practical possibilities within the time and technical constraints is a key skill here!). This should be
detailed and clear, and include *any* contribution you made to the project.

THEMES
Discuss the main themes of your PROJECT and how you approached communicating them through the project. 
Remember: the module is called 'coding for the arts', so think about how you approached expressing 
your ideas through the technical aspects of the project!

DESIGN
Discuss the overall mechanical aspects of the project. Think about how it connects with your themes
above if you did not already cover it there. You should also discuss how your design was informed by your
understanding of the technical systems that you were taught in class (and particular those required by
the assessment brief).

AESTHETIC DIMENSIONS
As a group, how did you ensure parity between the aesthetic, technical and thematic demands of the
project? Again, think about how your artistic and/or aesthetic choices were informed by your understanding
of the technical systems of the project.

UNREALISED ASPECTS OF PROJECT
Discuss here any aspects of the project you would have included if you had more time. Think about technical
issues you had and how you might go about trying to fix them (or how you'd start the research process) if
time and scope allowed. What other mechanics or ideas would you have implemented with more time? How would you
have gone about implementing these?

You may include more titles and text if you desire beyond the above titles if you want. Put them here at the bottom.
You may, for instance, want to include a narrative section if story is particularly important to your project.
